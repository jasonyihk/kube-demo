      'title' => 'Infinitus Cooperates with Nobel Laureate to Advance Immune Regulation with TCM',
      'content' => 'On March 6, 2017, Infinitus (China) Company Limited, a member of LKK Health Products Group (LKKHPG), appointed the Nobel laureate Professor Jules A. Hoffmann as an Infinitus Scientific Advisor, and the signing ceremony took place in Guangzhou, China.

        Infinitus will establish a long-term strategic partnership with Prof. Hoffmann and his team from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), and will carry out in-depth cooperation in anti-virus activities, gut immunity and other fields with TCM to favour the application of basic research to Chinese herbal health products. This is expected to further regulate human immunity and enhance the ability to prevent and treat diseases.

        Prof. Hoffmann has devoted his life to the study of innate immunity. Recognised as a pioneer in this area, he has been elected to the national academies of sciences from many countries, including the U.S., France, Germany and Russia. He and his associates have discovered the role of the Toll transmembrane receptor in sensing pathogenic micro-organisms. The discovery of this key principle has provided a basis for understanding the activation of the adaptive immune response by innate immunity and has opened new paths in the prevention and treatment of major immunity-related diseases. Because of this, he has won many well-known international awards, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2011.

        Regarding the partnership, Prof. Hoffmann commented, "The efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine is getting more and more attention nowadays. Its important role in immune regulation has become a global academic interest, which warrants the development of basic research in this area. Given the significant achievements and the solid strength in R&D, Infinitus is an ideal partner for such undertakings."

        Infinitus has been dedicated to providing the public with high-quality Chinese herbal health products and services for 25 years. In 1994, Infinitus brought into market its first compound polysaccharides-based product, Infinitus Health Tonic, which acts on regulating the human immunity and has leading market shares in China now. In addition, Infinitus has cooperated with Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other authoritative institutions for the immunity research of TCM compound polysaccharides. In 2012, Infinitus launched the Polysac™ compound polysaccharides, which attained patents from both China and America, and further strengthened its position in the immunity research of Chinese herbal medicine.

        Mr. Harry Yeung, Senior Vice President of LKKHPG said, "With Nobel laureate\'s achievements in immunity system and Infinitus\' experience in TCM research, the cooperation will further strengthen Infinitus\' R&D capability in immune regulation with TCM, from which consumers will benefit via high-quality Chinese herbal health products with more remarkable effects."',

      'content' => 'A groundbreaking ceremony for Guangzhou Infinitus Plaza, constructed on plot No. AB2910019 in Baiyun New Town, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, was held on November 15, 2016. The plot of land was acquired by LKK Health Products Group (LKKHPG), through its member Guangdong Infinitus Property Development Company Ltd., in May 2016 for RMB 2.01 billion (approx. USD 294 million). World-leading architect Zaha Hadid, who was known as the "Queen of the Curve", served as the designer of the project. It is the first project among Zaha Hadid\'s final architectural works to break ground.

      Mr. Lee Man Tat, Lee Kum Kee Group Chairman and his wife, Mr. Charlie Lee, Chairman of Lee Kum Kee Sauce Group, Mr. Sammy Lee, Chairman & Managing Director of LKKHPG and his wife, and Mr. Satoshi Ohashi, Director of Zaha Hadid Architects in the Far East, as well as more than 500 distinguished guests and journalists attended the ceremony.

      Guangzhou Infinitus Plaza will be a complex of modern buildings that combines health, fashion, environmental conservation and intelligent technologies, comprising several facilities including a new global R&D centre, a Chinese herbal medicine research and safety assessment centre, as well as a corporate exhibition centre and gallery. It will serve as the new headquarters of Infinitus (China) Company Ltd., a member of LKKHPG, meeting Infinitus\' projected business and office needs for the next 10 to 15 years. The overall investment in the project will reach RMB 4.5 billion (approx. USD 659 million), and the construction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020.

      "24 years ago, Infinitus started its business in Baiyun District. And today, 24 years later, Infinitus embarks on its new journey here again," said Mr. Harry Yeung, Senior Vice President of LKKHPG. "Guangzhou Infinitus Plaza reflects Infinitus\' commitment to the health industry and the Spirit of Constant Entrepreneurship. It will bring customers and employees a dynamic new environment, and drive the economic growth of Baiyun District and the surrounding areas. "

      Mr. Satoshi Ohashi enjoyed 30 years of working experience with Zaha Hadid. He said: "Ms. Zaha Hadid gave a high evaluation and expectations of this work. The design of Guangzhou Infinitus Plaza continues her legacy. As she had referred, this fluidity of the architecture had the coherence and intricacy of nature. Infinitus has a vision for nurturing healthier lives and adheres to the Spirit of Constant Entrepreneurship. Zaha Hadid has translated this to create a new workplace environment that nurtures openness and communication. The design activates the city and its surrounding conditions, while implementing the latest technologic solutions and construction methods to create a functional, adaptable and enjoyable workplace."

      Guangzhou Infinitus Plaza just looks unlike a workplace. Designed as a series of "infinite rings" that bring everyone together and follow the arrangement of the symbol for infinity - ∞ - Zaha Hadid organized all departments within Guangzhou Infinitus Plaza around the central atria and courtyards that foster open communication and interaction. The buildings were designed to maximise the amount of natural light entering the interior while the exterior surfaces provide sun shading and rain collection systems. Connected walkways improve communication for all employees. Walking and jogging courses as well as a garden of Chinese herbal plants and flora on the roof enable all employees and visitors to maintain an active lifestyle.

      The health industry will embrace broader development space under the guidance of the national strategy "Healthy China". Upon completion, Guangzhou Infinitus Plaza will be an important anchor to the health industry development of Baiyun District, contributing to the local economy with excellent employment opportunities.

      Guangzhou Infinitus Plaza is the first large project in which LKKHPG conducted site selection, conceptual planning, and construction all by itself in Chinese Mainland. LKKHPG had earlier acquired the Infinitus Centre in Zhujiang New Town, Guangzhou; the Infinitus Plaza in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong; and the Shanghai Corporate Avenue 3 (soon to be renamed Infinitus Tower) in Huangpu District, Shanghai. This collection of quality properties is expected to meet the long-term development goals of LKKHPG while providing strong support for the sustainable and healthy development of Infinitus\' business.',

      'title' => 'Infinitus Leads Chinese Herbal Health Product Brands with a Brand Value of RMB 65.869 Billion',
      'content' => 'On June 22, the World Brand Lab announced the list of China\'s 500 Most Valuable Brands 2017 in Beijing. Infinitus, a well-known brand of Chinese herbal health products under LKK Health Products Group, ranked 45th with a brand value of RMB 65.869 billion. It is also the only Chinese health product brand in top 50.

      The total value of China\'s 500 Most Valuable Brands 2017 was RMB 15,558.006 billion, and the threshold increased to RMB 2.315 billion. According to this latest list, there are significant changes in the rankings. High-tech companies such as Tencent and Huawei have overtaken traditional industries as the new front-runners. Meanwhile, with the vigorous development of the health industry, Infinitus, the brand of Chinese herbal health products, has been experiencing a strong growth.

      Over the last decade, Infinitus\' brand value has grown significantly and has been climbing up the rankings. According to the China\'s 500 Most Valuable Brands 2005, Infinitus\' brand value was RMB 8.083 billion. In 2011, the value increased to RMB 19.558 billion. In 2014, the value climbed to RMB 36.889 billion, and in 2017, it is valued at RMB 65.869 billion.

      "The sales of Infinitus have increased greatly in the past years, which means there is a significant increase in the capacity of the industry. For Infinitus, maintaining a steady climb in market share means it is more competitive and unique than its peers," said Mr. Ravi Dhar, a senior professor at the Yale School of Management.

      In the context of China\'s aging society and the government\'s policy of "Healthy China 2030", the room for the development of Chinese herbal health products is enormous. By enhancing customer experience with innovative strategies and initiatives, Infinitus grasps the market opportunity to realise continuous growth of brand value.

      Solid philosophy enables the stable development of the brand. Infinitus upholds the health philosophy: get a healthy life by nourishing the inside. It is transformed into simple and easy daily practices, and is promoted though a series of "Walking Day" activities to raise the public awareness of health and to guide people with healthy living habits.

      Product innovation is an important element to enhance brand competitiveness. Infinitus invests over RMB 100 million for product research and development annually. In 2016, 15 new products have been introduced to the market, with Infinitus owning a total of 133 products. It also has more than 244 authorised patents, independent research technologies and core intellectual property rights.

      Scientific research is also an important winning "weapon" for enterprises. Infinitus has established a R&D system featuring  "one centre and multiple scientific research platforms" and cooperated with renowned universities and research institutes locally and internationally. The Cambridge Infinitus Research Centre was jointly established by Infinitus and the University of Cambridge in 2015. This year, Infinitus also formed a long-term strategic partnership with Professor Jules A. Hoffmann, the Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine, to further strengthen its R&D capability on immune regulation of Chinese herbal health products.

      In brand building, Infinitus focuses on the customer experience. The "Source Tracing Trip" enables customers to experience the high-quality products from the origin. Furthermore, Infinitus hosts the health experience pavilion in China to raise the joy of the new Chinese herbal medicine by conditioning the immune system.

      In terms of service, Infinitus attaches great importance to the investment and application of digital technology, in order to offer more convenient services for customers.

      At the same time, Infinitus sticks to corporate social responsibility, and carries out innovative public welfare projects, such as theInfinitus Happy Football Programme, for the physical and mental health of the rural teenagers; and the Si Li Ji Ren Education Dream Support Programme, to provide financial aid and education opportunities to students from poverty areas.

      Professor Ravi Dhar pointed out that the key to the sustainable development and market success is to explore new areas of growth, and build a differentiated competitive advantage. With broad perspective and continuous innovation, Infinitus will gain an upper hand in the future development and win more room for growth.
